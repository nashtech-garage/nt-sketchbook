<Title>Typography</Title>

To use a type class in your component, simply add a class name corresponding to the size you wish to use.
For example `text-xl` or `text-2xl`

You can also use helper classes such as `font-extrabold`, `font-bold` and `font-semibold` to set font weights to 800, 700 and 600.
These are useful so you can easily set the weight of your text, especially if you don't need any other styling for that element.
